# nonogramSolver
A solver for nonogram puzzles

A Java-based solver for nonogram puzzles (also known as picross, griddlers, or paint by numbers).

## What are Nonograms?

Nonograms are picture logic puzzles where you fill in cells in a grid to reveal a hidden image. Each row and column has number clues that indicate the length of consecutive filled blocks in that line. For example, a clue of "3 1" means there's a block of 3 consecutive filled cells, followed by at least one empty cell, then a block of 1 filled cell.
